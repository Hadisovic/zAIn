## Visual Feedback

The blob changes color to show what's happening:

- **Purple** = Idle, ready to chat
- **Cyan** = Being dragged around
- **Blue with glow** = AI is thinking/responding
- **Light blue** = Textbox is open

---

## Troubleshooting

### Textbox doesn't appear when I click
- **Check:** Is the blob visible? (should be bottom-right corner)
- **Fix:** Make sure you clicked directly on the blob, not nearby

### Textbox closes immediately
- **Check:** Did you click outside of it?
- **Fix:** Click only on the input field and send button

### Blob moves when I tried to click
- **Check:** Did your mouse move >5px during click?
- **Why:** The app distinguishes between click (no movement) and drag (movement)
- **Fix:** Click smoothly without moving the cursor

### I can't find the chat history
- **Fix:** Press Ctrl+Space to open full chat panel
- **Note:** Chat history persists between sessions

### Voice not working
- **Check:** Is your audio device connected?
- **Fix:** Check settings (gear icon in chat panel)

## Tips

✨ **Drag the blob to a convenient spot** — it stays where you leave it  
✨ **Quick messages** — just click and type, no need to open full chat  
✨ **Persistent chat** — click Ctrl+Space anytime to see full history  
✨ **Always accessible** — blob stays on top of other windows  
✨ **Non-intrusive** — blob is small and doesn't steal focus
